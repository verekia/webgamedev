# ðŸŽ¾ Physics

You can move around meshes using absolute positioning and math, but at some point you will probably
want to use a physics engine to make things move and collide with each other in a more realistic way
(and with less custom code). Here are the physics engines available for the web and a quick
introduction to how they work.

## Rigid Bodies

In game development, a rigid body is a point in space controlled by the physics engine. It has a
mass, can be moved by forces and velocity, and may be affected by gravity. To move a mesh of your
scene using the physics engine, associate a rigid body to it, and set the mesh position to the one
of its rigid body at each (fixed) update.

On its own, a rigid body doesn't have a shape, and doesn't collide with other objects. It's simply a
point than can be moved around and rotated. In order to behave like a real object, we need to give
it a collider.

## Colliders

Colliders are shapes that define the volume of a rigid body to detect collisions with other objects.
There are many different types of colliders such as boxes, spheres, or capsules. Pick the simplest
shape that is the closest to what your mesh looks like. For instance for a human character, you can
use a capsule collider. An other useful collider is the convex hull, which is a shape that fits
around a mesh. It is useful for meshes that do not fit in simple shapes, like a house or a tree for
instance.

## Body Type

A rigid body can be **dynamic**, **static** (or fixed), or **kinematic**.

- A **dynamic** rigid body is affected by gravity and forces, can be moved, and can collide with
  other rigid bodies. It's the standard type of rigid body for most moving things in a scene.
- A **static** (or fixed) rigid body is a body that cannot move. It can collide with other rigid
  bodies, which makes it a good choice for walls or floors.
- A **kinematic** rigid body means that it is controlled by the physics engine, but it is not
  affected by forces. It is moved by setting its velocity or position directly. This is useful for
  moving platforms or elevators, or other objects that need to be moved around by the game logic,
  but cause collisions.

## Velocity, Acceleration, Forces

You can move rigid bodies by setting their **position**, **velocity**, **acceleration**, or applying
**forces** to them.

## Friction

Colliders have a certain friction coefficient. This basically means how "sticky" or how "slippery"
they are when they collide with each other. Spider-Man can climb a vertical wall because his hands
have a very high friction, which when combined with the friction of the wall, is stronger than
gravity. In games you typically want walls that are not climbable to have a friction of 0 to be
completely slippery if the player jumps against them.

## Fixed step

Physics are typically calculated on a fixed step or update. These fixed updates are called
independently of the framerate. This means that if the framerate drops, the physics will still be
calculated at the same rate and your moving objects will not appear to slow down. In Unity, the
default fixed update rate is 50 times per second. Using a fixed update also saves CPU time, because
you don't need to calculate physics every frame if your framerate is higher than the fixed update
rate.

[Here is a useful video on the topic of fixed updates and delta time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ki_ngP5vwc),
and a [Gaffer On Games article](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/).

## Interpolation

Since the physics engine is using fixed updates to calculate the position of the rigid bodies, the
position of the rigid bodies will not be in sync with the frame rate. If your fixed update rate is
set at 60 or 50, the desynchronization might not be very noticeable, so let's take an extreme
example to understand the situation.

Imagine you are running at 90 FPS, but you set the fixed update rate to 1 per second. Looking around
with the camera will be very smooth, but any object moving in your scene with physics will appear to
teleport to a different position every second. We are saving a lot on CPU cycles for physics, but
object movements are very choppy. This is where interpolation comes in. Interpolation is a technique
to smooth out the movement of objects by estimating their position at the current frame based on
their last known physics position and velocity.

When using React Three Fiber and Rapier, interpolation can be handled by
[react-three-rapier](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier/blob/main/packages/react-three-rapier/src/Physics.tsx).
