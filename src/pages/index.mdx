{/* The shortest path from web dev to game dev */}

This website is a **work-in-progress collection of resources** on techniques and tools around JavaScript game development, which apply to 2D and 3D games, and to visual experiences that are not _games_. There is a lot of placeholders and unredacted content at the moment. [**Join the
