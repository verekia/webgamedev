## What is this event?

The Web Game Dev Open Jam is an **open-source** game jam where we make **browser games**! It's a **one-month** event to give busy people a chance to participate, and it **starts on April 1st**! _#NotAJoke_

We are a JavaScript community, so most games will use engines like <ThreeLogo /> [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), <R3FLogo /> [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/), <BabylonLogo /> [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), <PlayCanvasLogo /> [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/), <PixiLogo /> [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/), or <PhaserLogo /> [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), but **all engines and libraries are welcome** as long as the games are **open-source** and **run in the browser** (you can use <UnityLogo /> [Unity](https://unity.com/), <GodotLogo /> [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), or ü¶Ä [Rust](https://www.webgamedev.com/engines-libraries/rust-game-dev) Wasm exports).

It is **not a competition**, and there are **no winners or prizes**. There is also **no theme** so build whatever you want! It's a relaxed event to create cool games with cool people, learn new things, make friends, and have fun. Participating in multiple projects or giving occasional feedback or help without committing to a project is fine too.

## How to participate?

1. [**Join the Web Game Dev Discord**](https://webgamedev.com/discord) and the [**itch.io jam**](https://itch.io/jam/web-game-dev-open-jam-april-2023) (optional).
2. **React with the üçì emoji** in the [**#üìú rules-and-roles**](https://discord.com/channels/1032873609280106566/1044288936303923210) channel (and read the Discord server rules).
3. Go to the [**#üçì jam-projects**](https://discord.com/channels/1032873609280106566/1091010318446100612) channel and check out the projects!

- If there is a project you like, **let the author know how you can help**. They will decide if it's a good fit.
- If you are available but don't have a project idea, you can create a post with the üôã **Available** tag.
- Or create a new post to **propose your own project**! Read the guidelines when creating the post.

During the jam, use the game's original post in [**#üçì jam-projects**](https://discord.com/channels/1032873609280106566/1091010318446100612) to share updates or chat about the game. You can also add your teammates as friends and create a private group chat on Discord. Use [**#ü•§jam-general**](https://discord.com/channels/1032873609280106566/1091010541620834336) to discuss the event, game ideas, ask questions, or just hang out.

If needed, we can provide repositories on the [Web Game Dev GitHub organization](https://github.com/webgamedevs). Discuss which [Open Source license](https://choosealicense.com/) you want to use with your teammates. Please let them know if you intend to keep working on the game after the jam and potentially release it commercially, so the situation is clear for everyone.

Follow üê¶ [**@WebGameDevs**](https://x.com/webgamedevs) and use the [**#WebGameDevJam**](https://x.com/hashtag/WebGameDevJam) hashtag to share your progress!

üöÄ **Let's goooooo!** See you on [**Discord**](https://webgamedev.com/discord)! üëã
