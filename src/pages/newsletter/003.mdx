Happy new year, everyone! May 2023 be a great year for you and your game projects! 🎉 <br />Let's start the year with some fresh content to get the creative juices flowing.

## 🔥 Headlines

[**Webspaces**](https://webspaces.space/) is a new project by [Greg Fodor](https://twitter.com/gfodor) built on top of [**Mozilla Hubs**](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) to create and self-host 3D virtual spaces for users to visit. Webspaces are simple HTML files that can be edited directly from within the scenes they represent by writing to the [local file system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) or via GitHub pull requests. Visitors connect to each other via peer-to-peer WebRTC. Learn more in [**this blog post**](https://gfodor.medium.com/rebooting-the-web-in-3d-with-webspaces-9e58847e042c).

Greg also optimized and [packaged for NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smoothvoxels) a [**CLI tool**](https://github.com/webspace-sdk/svox-tools) for the [**Smooth Voxels**](https://svox.glitch.me/) library, which lets you create smooth 3D models from voxels that you can author with plain text! 🤯

<PlayCanvasLogo /> In the [last issue](/newsletter/002), we talked about
[Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/). This time, let's shed some light on
[**PlayCanvas**](https://playcanvas.com/), a full-featured WebGL 3D engine [owned by
Snap](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/snap-reportedly-buys-its-own-3d-game-engine/) (_not
sponsored_). It is composed of the open-source [**Engine**](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine),
which can be used on its own for a code-first approach, and the [**online
Editor**](https://playcanvas.com/features), which has [free and paid
plans](https://playcanvas.com/plans). Here is their [**2022
showcase**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46f73gp1_TU) and a [**crash
course**](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/tutorials/crash-course/) to get started. They also
make the [PCUI components library](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui).

<R3FLogo /> [**gltfjsx**](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx) [**v6 is
out**](https://twitter.com/0xca0a/status/1605566666066124802). It's a CLI and
[online](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/) tool to generate JSX components for [**React Three
Fiber**](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber). This new version features [better
compression](https://twitter.com/0xca0a/status/1608598267922636800) via the `--transform` and
`--simplify` flags, thanks to [Don McCurdy](https://www.donmccurdy.com/)'s
[**glTF-Transform**](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/),
[**Draco**](https://google.github.io/draco/), [**WebP**](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp),
and [**sharp**](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/). Optimize your models right from the CLI without
Blender!
