## üî• Headlines

üéô The [**Interview with Steven Yau**](https://www.webgamedev.com/interviews/steven-yau) ([_yaustar_](https://x.com/yaustar)) is out! Learn about the games industry from a veteran game developer who has worked for EA, King, and <PlayCanvasLogo /> PlayCanvas at Snapchat. Steven shared his thoughts on the web games ecosystem, monetization, web engines, and more. Come find Steven and the rest of us on [Discord](https://webgamedev.com/discord)!

<BabylonLogo /> Microsoft released [**Babylon.js 6.0**](https://www.babylonjs.com/)! See the
announcement [article](https://babylonjs.medium.com/announcing-babylon-js-6-0-dcb5f1662e3a) and
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsqpuRCQV28). The release includes Performance Priority
modes that can produce up to 50x faster rendering and performance, fluid rendering, improved
screen-space reflections, texture decals, new glTF extensions support, Node Material Ray Marching,
new Tri-Planar and Bi-Planar nodes, and the v1 of the GUI Editor. But the feature that is getting
the most attention is the integration of [**Havok**](https://www.havok.com/), a physics engine that
powers [numerous AAA games](https://www.havok.com/havok-powered/#section-portfolio). This Havok
integration comes with a complete overhaul of the Babylon.js Physics API with Physics V2. Physics V2
performs up to 20x faster than V1, which is based on either Cannon.js, Oimo.js, or Ammo.js. Try
Havok in the [Playroom demo](https://theplayroom.babylonjs.com/)!

This is all fantastic news for Babylon.js users, but that doesn't end there. **Havok for the Web** is also available as an MIT-licensed standalone [Wasm library](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/packages/tools/babylonServer/public/havok) that can be used with any engine and is [available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babylonjs/havok) with TypeScript typings! üòç [N8](https://x.com/N8Programs) already created a [Three.js integration demo](https://n8python.github.io/havokDemo/) ([repo](https://github.com/N8python/havokDemo)) with 10.000 rigid bodies.

<WebGPULogo /> [**Chrome 113 is out of the beta channel and rolling out to
stable**](https://x.com/Tojiro/status/1653504985488068608), so WebGPU is now available to up-to-date
Chrome users without any flag. Let the revolution begin! üéâ
