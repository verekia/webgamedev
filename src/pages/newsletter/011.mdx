## üî• Headlines

<R3FLogo /> [Douges](https://x.com/itsdouges) released
[**TRIPLEX**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@triplex/run), the React Three Fiber editor that saves
scene changes back to source. See the [introduction
video](https://x.com/itsdouges/status/1628646325784023046) for a demo. TRIPLEX is a standalone
server that runs alongside your project and is therefore compatible with any bundler and framework,
including Next.js and Remix. Run `npx @triplex/run init` in a new folder to give it a try! Note that
there is also the [react-three-editor](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-editor), which is
currently a plugin for Vite.

[**Ambient**](https://www.ambient.run/) was released ([blog post](https://www.ambient.run/post/introducing-ambient)). It is a multiplayer game engine powered by Rust, WebAssembly, and WebGPU. It features a GPU-driven physically-based-rendering engine, [PhysX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX)-powered physics, a React-like UI system, spatial audio with composable filters, platform-independent user input, and more.

<WebXRLogo /> <ThreeLogo /> Meta open-sourced [**Project
Flowerbed**](https://flowerbed.metademolab.com/), their WebXR showcase game
([repo](https://github.com/meta-quest/ProjectFlowerbed)). They also published a very [**in-depth
article**](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/project-flowerbed-a-webxr-case-study/) containing many
workflow and performance tips useful for any WebGL game. It complements nicely their previous
[**WebXR talk**](https://web.facebook.com/RealityLabs/videos/783508189585692) at Meta Connect about
Flowerbed. [David Heaney](https://x.com/Heaney555) wrote an
[article](https://uploadvr.com/project-flowerbed-webxr-minigolf-open-source-demos/) about how
Project Flowerbed and [Above Par-adowski](https://aboveparadowski.com/) prove WebXR can be used for
full VR games.

[**SwissGL**](https://github.com/google/swissgl) ([demo](https://google.github.io/swissgl/)) is a minimalistic wrapper on top of the WebGL2 JS API by [Alex Mordvintsev](https://x.com/zzznah). It is an early-stage experiment at Google but is not an officially supported Google product at the moment.
