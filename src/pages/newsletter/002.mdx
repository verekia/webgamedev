This is the second issue of the **Web Game Dev Newsletter**! üöÄ

## üî• Headlines

**2 node-based shader graph editors** got released: [**NodeToy**](https://nodetoy.co/), a platform to create, fork, share, and export shader effects to GLSL, or to [Three.js](https://github.com/NodeToy/three-nodetoy) and [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/NodeToy/react-nodetoy) via a NodeToy URL in your components. If NodeToy is a little too _platform-y_ for you, you will like [**Alma**](https://www.alma.sh/) by [Emil Widlund](https://x.com/emilwidlund), a similar tool to create GLSL shaders via a neat UI that lets you jump right into a graph playground without any account.

<WebGPULogo /> It looks like we may be getting [**WebGPU in Chrome
desktop**](https://x.com/Tojiro/status/1603087438150217728) sometime around May 2022!

<ThrelteLogo /> [**SvelteKit hit version 1.0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEJ-Rnm2yOE), which
is the perfect opportunity to bring your attention to [**Threlte**](https://threlte.xyz/), the
equivalent of React Three Fiber in the [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/) world. Thanks to the way
Svelte works, you can animate Threlte objects directly instead of manipulating the underlying
Three.js object via refs like you would do in R3F. The version 5 of Threlte got released recently
with some [major changes](https://threlte.xyz/core-transition), including an API that's closer to
R3F, but the docs are still transitioning to the new paradigm. Note that Threlte has
[built-in](https://threlte.xyz/rapier/rigid-body) support for the [**Rapier**](https://rapier.rs/)
physics engine!

<ThreeLogo /> [Anderson Mancini](https://x.com/Andersonmancini) hosted a [**Three.js
event**](https://x.com/i/spaces/1RDGlapyYjjJL) on Twitter Spaces with [Bruno
Simon](https://x.com/bruno_simon), [N8](https://x.com/N8Programs), and [Nicolas
Carvajal](https://x.com/nicolas_web3).

<WebXRLogo /> There is now an experimental API to bring up a [**WebXR System
Keyboard**](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/web/webxr-keyboard/) on Meta Quest.
