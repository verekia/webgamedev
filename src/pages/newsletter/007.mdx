## üî• Headlines

<WebGLLogo /> <WebGPULogo /> The Khronos [**WebGL + WebGPU
meetup**](https://www.khronos.org/events/webgl-webgpu-meetup-january-2023) is today, January 31st,
at 5pm PST (8pm EST, 2am Central Europe) and will include presentations by [Ken
Russell](https://x.com/gfxprogrammer) (Khronos,
Google), <ThreeLogo /> [mrdoob](https://x.com/mrdoob), Kelsey Gilbert (Mozilla) and John Anderson
(Google Earth). [Omar Shehata](https://x.com/Omar4ur) writes
[recaps](https://omar-shehata.medium.com/webgl-webgpu-april-2022-meetup-highlights-e57ad07e1f60) of
those recurring meetups.

<WebGPULogo /> **Chrome Canary on Android** now [**supports
WebGPU**](https://x.com/Tojiro/status/1618997822854168582) if you toggle the `#enable-unsafe-webgpu`
flag.

[**Automerge 2.0**](https://automerge.org/blog/automerge-2/) got released. It's a [Conflict-free Replicated Data Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) (CRDT) library for Rust and JavaScript to facilitate state synchronization between Peer-to-Peer clients or client and server. Here is an [introduction](https://automerge.org/docs/hello/) to the concept. It's like Git for objects, with [automatic conflict resolution](https://automerge.org/docs/cookbook/conflicts/). CRDTs are used for real-time collaborative applications (like Google Docs or Figma), offline-first apps, and P2P decentralized apps and games. Not something you'll need for most games, but it's good to know that it exists if you someday run into concurrency issues when multiple players try to mutate a game state simultaneously. [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/) is a popular alternative.

I listed the **download sizes** of all games on the ‚ú® [**Games & Demos**](https://www.webgamedev.com/games-demos) page and üéÆ [**WebGamer.io**](https://webgamer.io/), which you can see on game thumbnails on both pages. That's the total transferred size from hard refresh to actual gameplay. The smallest games boot with **as little as 3MB** and go **up to 87MB**. With a fast CDN, parallelized downloads, and a background download strategy, games under 20MB or even 30MB can load quickly or almost instantly. On mobile, [53% of users](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/mobile-site-load-time-statistics/) leave a web page if it takes **more than 3 seconds to load**, so try to show the main menu as fast as possible and keep downloading well-compressed and optimized resources in the background.
