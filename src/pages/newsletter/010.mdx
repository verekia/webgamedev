## 🔥 Headlines

[**Web Push**](https://web.dev/push-notifications-overview/) for Home Screen web apps and **third-party browser support for Add to Home Screen** are (_finally_) [**supported on iOS and iPadOS**](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/). This is a big win for PWA games! Learn more about 🌐 [**Progressive Web Apps**](https://www.webgamedev.com/publishing/pwa).

<PixiLogo /> [**PixiJS**](https://beta.pixijs.com/), the 2D WebGL library by Goodboy ([now
Playco](https://www.play.co/press/playco-official-press-release-210928-en)), has [**big plans for
2023**](https://beta.pixijs.com/blog/pixi-universe). They assembled a full-time team to work on
releasing a [new website](https://beta.pixijs.com/) (✅ done), an updated [PixiJS
React](https://pixijs.io/pixi-react/) (✅ done), open-source games, a UI library, the
framework-agnostic AssetPack library, a CLI bootstrapping tool, dev tools, the Comet editor, PixiJS
v8, PixiJS 3D, and a game engine. 🤯 That's one hell of a roadmap!

<KaboomLogo /> Last month, [**Kaboom**](https://3000.kaboomjs.com/) by [Replit](https://replit.com/)
released their [v3000 beta](https://3000.kaboomjs.com/blog/3000). See [this
thread](https://x.com/Kaboomjs/status/1620176734187569155) for video examples of the new features,
which include a scene graph, more font formats, tweening, rotated areas, up to [50x performance
improvement](https://3000.kaboomjs.com/blog/3000-perf), custom loading screens, post effects,
gamepad support, and pathfinding.

<WasmLogo /> [**Tangle**](https://x.com/kettlecorn/status/1626338465041317891) is a new experimental
library by [Ian Kettlewell](https://x.com/kettlecorn) that syncs WebAssembly apps and games between
multiple users in peer-to-peer via WebRTC connections (initialized by a central server). Try the
[demo](https://tanglesync.com/)!

<GltfLogo /> [Don McCurdy](https://x.com/donrmccurdy) released [**glTF Transform
3.0**](https://x.com/donrmccurdy/status/1626229203145494544). New additions include flattening the
scene graph, joining meshes to reduce draw calls, AVIF image compression, sparse data compression,
and an all-in-one `optimize` command.

<CssLogo /> One of the most demanded CSS features, [**Container
Queries**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries), is now supported
in all [three major browser engines](https://web.dev/cq-stable/) ([Can I
Use](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) Global support: 80%). Container Queries allow you to
style a container based on its content instead of the viewport. This will change how we approach
responsive design, including CSS-based game UI!
