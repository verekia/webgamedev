Welcome to the first issue of the **Web Game Dev Newsletter**!

## 🔥 Headlines

<R3FLogo /> We've got 2 new work-in-progress projects to bring scene changes back to React Three
Fiber source code: [**React Three Editor**](https://twitter.com/0xca0a/status/1601315795006410752)
by [Nikhil Saraf](https://twitter.com/nkSaraf98), and a [proof of
concept](https://twitter.com/itsdouges/status/1597178413449904129) by
[DOUGES](https://twitter.com/itsdouges) which uses Deno and [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com/).

<WebXRLogo /> Great news for **WebXR** developers: Meta Quest browser now supports [**immersive
navigation**](https://twitter.com/rcabanier/status/1598382690327097344), which means you can now
change _same-origin_ URL routes within a WebXR session (yep, that was surprisingly not possible
before). This is a step forward for metaverse experiences, and also opens up interesting ways to
build XR games around traditional URL routes (like seamlessly going from `/my-house` to `/worldmap`
or `/arena`). It is also now possible to [**send a link from desktop or
mobile**](https://twitter.com/00davehill00/status/1597770283762388993) to Quest headsets, to not
have to type URLs.

## ⬆️ Updates

<ThreeLogo /> [**Three.js 147**](https://twitter.com/threejs/status/1597864405445722112) – Everybody
is in love with the [**pixel postprocessing
effect**](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=pixel#webgl_postprocessing_pixel)
([changelog](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r147), [migration
guide](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Migration-Guide#146--147)).
