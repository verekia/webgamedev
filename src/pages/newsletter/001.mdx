Welcome to the first issue of the **Web Game Dev Newsletter**!

## üî• Headlines

<R3FLogo /> We've got 2 new work-in-progress projects to bring scene changes back to React Three
Fiber source code: [**React Three Editor**](https://x.com/0xca0a/status/1601315795006410752) by
[Nikhil Saraf](https://x.com/nkSaraf98), and a [proof of
concept](https://x.com/itsdouges/status/1597178413449904129) by [DOUGES](https://x.com/itsdouges)
which uses Deno and [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com/).

<WebXRLogo /> Great news for **WebXR** developers: Meta Quest browser now supports [**immersive
navigation**](https://x.com/rcabanier/status/1598382690327097344), which means you can now change
_same-origin_ URL routes within a WebXR session (yep, that was surprisingly not possible before).
This is a step forward for metaverse experiences, and also opens up interesting ways to build XR
games around traditional URL routes (like seamlessly going from `/my-house` to `/worldmap` or
`/arena`). It is also now possible to [**send a link from desktop or
mobile**](https://x.com/00davehill00/status/1597770283762388993) to Quest headsets, to not have to
type URLs.
