## üî• Headlines

<PlayCanvasLogo /> [Solar Games](https://solargames.io/) released their [**Uranus
Tools**](https://solargames.io/tools/) for [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/), a collection of
drag-and-drop scripts that extend the PlayCanvas editor with features such as automatic GPU
instancing, open-world terrains, advanced material effects, a cross-platform multiplayer-enabled
player controller, 3D spatial audio chat, video and screen sharing, and a lot more. They use Uranus
Tools in the updated demo of
[**Aritelia**](https://x.com/PlayingInCanvas/status/1625461178800431110), which looks better than
ever!

<ThreeLogo /> [Roman Liutikov](https://x.com/roman01la) open-sourced
[**ThreeGN**](https://threegn.app/) ([repo](https://github.com/roman01la/threegn)), a port of
Blender's geometry nodes system for the browser using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) and
[Three.js](https://threejs.org/). Read his [devlog
article](https://www.romanliutikov.com/blog/threegn-1.html) for more details. Note that Roman
doesn't intend to evolve the project. It is a proof of concept that others may use as a foundation
to build upon.

<WebXRLogo /> <ThreeLogo /> [Felix Zhang](https://x.com/felix_trz) published
[**LogXR**](https://x.com/felix_trz/status/1624227962064363521), a WebXR console for Three.js
(support for Babylon.js coming soon). Felix also developed the [Immersive Web
Emulator](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/webxr-development-immersive-web-emulator/) mentioned in
last week's issue.

<GodotLogo /> In the native world, [**Godot 4.0 RC
1**](https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-0-rc-1/) got released, and the Godot
Editor is now [available on Google
Play](https://godotengine.org/article/android_godot_editor_play_store_beta_release/).
