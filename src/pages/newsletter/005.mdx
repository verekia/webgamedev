## 🔥 Headlines

<CocosLogo /> **Duelyst**, a turn-based strategy game that [shut down in early
2020](https://steamcommunity.com/games/291410/announcements/detail/1688222120329073284), just got
[**open-sourced**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3Cuz6d_7x0). You can still play on their
[staging deployment](https://staging.duelyst.org/). It was coded with
[Cocos2d-JS](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-js), a library merged into
[Cocos2d-x](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x), which is now legacy, and got merged into the
[cocos-engine](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine), which you can use via [**Cocos
Creator**](https://www.cocos.com/en/creator) (_are you following?_ 😅). Cocos Creator is a
Unity-like cross-platform editor which [supports TypeScript and
JavaScript](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/scripting/language-support.html).

<WebGPULogo /> [**Use.GPU**](https://usegpu.live/) ([GitLab
repo](https://gitlab.com/unconed/use.gpu)) is a _set of declarative, reactive WebGPU legos_ by
[Steven Wittens](https://acko.net/). It's a standalone
[React-like](https://usegpu.live/docs/guides-live-vs-react) library that uses **JSX**. [**Version
0.8**](https://acko.net/blog/use-gpu-goes-trad/) ([Hacker News
thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34384719)) brings conveniences like scenes and nodes
with matrices, mesh instancing, shadow maps, visibility culling, and a new rendering pipeline.
[Learn more](https://acko.net/blog/the-case-for-use-gpu/).

<GltfLogo /> [NYTimes](https://twitter.com/NYTimesRD) released **Vite and Rollup plugins** to
[**optimize 3D glTF
assets**](https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/optimizing-3d-gltf-assets-for-interactive-journalism). By
[Don McCurdy](https://twitter.com/donrmccurdy) and [Or Fleisher](https://twitter.com/juniorxsound).

<JavascriptLogo /> The results of the [**State of JS 2022**](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/) are
available. For a TLDR, check out the [tier
list](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/#tier_list) ([Fireship
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdiYtiKD8eI)). A safe bet is still
[React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), but I
can see [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) gaining more traction thanks to
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) this year.
