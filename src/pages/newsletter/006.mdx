## 🔥 Headlines

🎙 The [**interview with Dek**](/interviews/dek-hordes), creator of **JavaScript MMORPG [Hordes](https://hordes.io/)**, is out! A truly inspiring journey. 💯

<PlayCanvasLogo /> Good news for [**PlayCanvas**](https://playcanvas.com/) users! PlayCanvas now
supports [**importing GLB / gLTF files into the
Editor**](https://blog.playcanvas.com/gltf-import-arrives-in-the-playcanvas-editor/), including 100%
of ratified [glTF extensions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/README.md).
It is also possible to directly edit the imported models' materials and hook up their animations
with PlayCanvas' animation system. In other news, [Steven Yau](https://x.com/yaustar) created a user
script to [**load Editor Plugin
scripts**](https://github.com/yaustar/yaustar.github.io/tree/master/playcanvas-editor-api-tools). It
is not an official PlayCanvas feature at the moment.

Not a _single_ JavaScript game won the [**GitHub Game Off 2022**](https://github.blog/2023-01-13-game-off-2022-winners/)... But a lot of the winning games are playable online via WebAssembly. You might want to take your chance with the [**Global Game Jam**](https://globalgamejam.org/) at your local [jam site](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites).
