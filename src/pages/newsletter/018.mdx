## üî• Headlines

<UnityLogo /> You may have heard that Unity is trying to introduce a [Runtime
Fee](https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates) based on installs for games
that earned more than $200,000 in the past 12 months and have at least 200,000 lifetime installs.
This also affects games that have already been released. To the surprise of no one except the genius
executives who came up with this idea, the community is not happy. Unity received a ton of backlash
and has already backpedaled on some of the new rules. Web games, for instance, are now exempt from
this fee. They will soon announce their revised pricing.

This fiasco has led to a surge of interest in <GodotLogo /> [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/), but if you have Unity refugee friends looking for new engines, send them over to [**üåê Web Game Engines & Libraries**](https://www.webgamedev.com/engines-libraries/web-game-engines-libraries)! In particular, <PlayCanvasLogo /> [**PlayCanvas**](https://playcanvas.com/), <RogueLogo /> [**Rogue Engine**](https://rogueengine.io/) (editor for Three.js), <BabylonLogo /> [**Babylon.js**](https://www.babylonjs.com/), <NeedleLogo /> [**Needle Engine**](https://needle.tools/), and <CocosLogo /> [**Cocos**](https://www.cocos.com/en/creator) may fulfill their needs.

It is built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), so it's a mix of Markdown and React. Let me know on
