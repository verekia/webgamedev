Selling PWAs, Thomas Steiner: Microsoft allows you to sell your app on their Windows Store, and so does Google if you wrap your app in a TWA (easy with http://PWABuilder.com). You can try the Digital Goods API on the Play Store (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/receive-payments-play-billing/).
