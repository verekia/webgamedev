# âœ¨Â Games & Demos

<NoBulletListStyles />

Before diving into web game development, you will probably wonder how far you can go with JavaScript and WebGL. Here is a collection of "HTML5 games" and tech demos that I find particularly impressive and polished.

<Callout style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: 20 }}>
  ðŸŽ‰ I created a more comfortable separate portal to showcase some of these games:
  [**WebGamer.io**](https://webgamer.io)
</Callout>

<div style={{ margin: '32px 0' }}>
  <Games />
</div>

## Metaverses

While not technically games, these web-based metaverses are built on top of WebGL and share many of the same challenges and solutions as games.

## WebAssembly

While it is not the focus of this website, it is worth mentioning that it is possible to run native code in the browser using WebAssembly. Here are some examples to give you an idea of the kind of performance you can expect from WebAssembly:

- <WasmLogo /> [**Flyff Universe**](https://universe.flyff.com/play) by
  [Gala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_Inc.)

  Invader](http://robotinvader.com/) ([video](https://x.com/WebXREngine/status/1714629904724271413))

## DOM-based games

Instead of drawing graphics on a `canvas`, you can create 2D games with DOM elements (`div`s, basically). Manipulating the DOM and using a lot of CSS effects can be expensive for the browser, particularly if you have many elements, but depending on your use case, it might work for you! Here are some examples:

- <CssLogo /> <VueLogo /> [**Kill The King**](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/full/MWeZWxQ) by
  [Jamie Coulter](https://x.com/jamiecoulter89)
- <CssLogo /> <JavascriptLogo /> [**Hack**](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/full/abYNyLq),
  [**CodepenLife**](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/full/YvgpZW),
  [**Toxic**](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/full/MWYKzaq) by [Jamie
  Coulter](https://x.com/jamiecoulter89)
- <CssLogo /> <ReactLogo /> [**Danger Crew**](https://thedangercrew.com/) ([talk

- <CssLogo /> <ReactLogo /> [**Ciabatta's Revenge**](https://drewconley.itch.io/ciabattas-revenge)
  ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UiwfGaQGFA)) by [Drew
  Conley](https://x.com/drewconley13)
- <CssLogo /> <ReactLogo /> [**Athena Crisis**](https://athenacrisis.com/) (upcoming) by [Christoph
  Nakazawa](https://x.com/cpojer)
- <CssLogo /> <ReactLogo /> [**Wilderplace**](https://wilderplace.place/) (Steam-only,
  [blog](https://trashmoon.com/blog/), [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWzHEWJi7IE)) by
  [Saman Bemel Benrud](https://trashmoon.com/)
- <CssLogo /> [**Match City**](https://dennissmuda.github.io/match-city/)
  ([source](https://github.com/DennisSmuda/match-city)) by [Dennis Smuda](https://dennissmuda.com/)
- <CssLogo /> [**The Mine**](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/full/NOMeEb) and [**The
  Caretaker**](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/full/WNxjVbW) are **pure CSS** (no JS) games by
  [Jamie Coulter](https://x.com/jamiecoulter89)

To make this kind of game, you can use a library like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to help architect your code.
